        <h2>Hello, World.</h2>
        <p>I am Uzaif, someone who believes curiosity is the starting point of every great journey. <br>
           I am a B.E. undergraduate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a strong inclination toward building practical, intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.
           My academic journey has strengthened my foundation in Data Structures, Algorithms, and software development, while hands-on projects have helped me understand how theory translates into scalable solutions.</p>

    <section class="card" id="journey">
        <div class="card-number">02</div>
        <div class="card-tag">Origin Story</div>
        <h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey started with simple questions: "How does this work?" and "Can I build something like this?"
           What began as small experiments soon became a passion. I realized that building things with logic
           and creativity gives me immense satisfaction. Over time, I learned that consistency matters more than speed.</p>

    <section class="card" id="story1">
        <div class="card-number">03</div>
        <div class="card-tag">First Power</div>
        <h2>First Coding Story</h2>
        <p>I still remember the first time I wrote a program. It was just a few lines of code,
           but when it worked, it felt magical. I ran it again and again, modified them, made changes, just to see stupid outputs.
           That small success made me realize that even complex systems start with simple steps.
           Since then, every bug I fix feels like solving a puzzle.</p>

    <section class="card" id="story2">
        <div class="card-number">04</div>
        <div class="card-tag">The Villain Arc</div>
        <h2>A Challenge I Faced</h2>
        <p>Not everything was easy. There were times when my code didn't work no matter how much I tried.
           Didn't sleep that day, frustated, tired.
           I once spent hours debugging a tiny mistake.
           That moment taught me patience, attention to detail, and resilience.
           I learned that frustration is part of growth, not a sign to quit.</p>

    <section class="card" id="interests">
        <div class="card-number">05</div>
        <div class="card-tag">Multiverse</div>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <p>I am deeply interested in exploring emerging technologies, particularly in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
            I enjoy studying innovative advancements, understanding how intelligent systems function internally, and analyzing how algorithms translate data into actionable insights.
            I am especially curious about real-world applications of AI and how technology can be leveraged to design efficient, scalable, and impactful solutions.
            <br>
            Beyond technical pursuits, I enjoy listening to music, observing human behavior, and reflecting on everyday challenges.
            I often think critically about how routine problems can be approached and solved in smarter, more optimized ways.
            This habit of analytical observation strengthens both my creative thinking and problem-solving mindset.</p>

    <section class="card" id="projects">
        <div class="card-number">06</div>
        <div class="card-tag">Experiments</div>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>This section highlights my practical experiments and project implementations where I translate theoretical concepts into real-world solutions.
            One of my key projects, <a class="links" href="https://github.com/uzzzaif/RuleCop-University-Violation-Detector"><strong>Rule-Cop</strong></a>, focuses on building an intelligent system designed to monitor, analyze, and enforce predefined rules using automation and logical decision-making.
            Through this project, I explored core AI and software engineering principles, including structured problem-solving, system design, and scalable implementation.
            My projects reflect my commitment to creating meaningful, impact-driven solutions while continuously strengthening my technical depth in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

        <div class="card-tag">The Mission</div>
        <h2>Future Goals</h2>
        <p>My goal is to continuously strengthen my expertise in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning while building scalable, real-world solutions that solve meaningful problems
            As an AI & ML undergraduate, I aim to apply strong foundations in Data Structures, Algorithms, and Software Development to design intelligent systems that create measurable impact.
            I seek to work on technically challenging projects that enhance my problem-solving ability, push my analytical thinking, and contribute to long-term innovation.
            I am committed to continuous learning, adaptability, and staying aligned with emerging technologies in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.</p>
